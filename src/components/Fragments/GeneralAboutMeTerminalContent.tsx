        with experience building modern, scalable web applications using React, 
        Next.js, Angular, and Vue. I develop responsive interfaces with Tailwind CSS, 
        Material UI, Shadcn/UI, and Radix UI, while leveraging tools like React Hook Form, 
        Zod, TanStack Query, RxJS, and Axios for efficient data handling and state management. 
        I’ve worked on digital learning platforms, internal enterprise tools, desktop 
        applications with Electron, and full-stack projects that integrate Java Spring Boot, 
        PostgreSQL, and RESTful APIs. With a strong focus on clean architecture, testing (Cypress, Vitest, Cucumber), 
        and performance, I enjoy delivering maintainable solutions and continuously expanding my technical skill set.
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm a passionate developer with a love for creating intuitive
        and efficient web applications.
